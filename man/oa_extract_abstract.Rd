\title{Extract abstract from inverted index}
\usage{
oa_extract_abstract(abstract_inverted_index)
}
\arguments{
\item{abstract_inverted_index}{List of inverted index data from OpenAlex API,
where each element is a named list with words as names and position vectors
as values}
}
\value{
Character vector of reconstructed abstracts, with NA for missing
or invalid abstract data
}
\description{
OpenAlex stores abstracts as inverted indexes (word -> position mappings)
for efficiency. This function reconstructs the original abstract text by
sorting words by their positions and concatenating them.
}
\details{
The function handles errors gracefully and falls back to NA when
the inverted index cannot be processed (e.g., malformed data, missing
positions).
