\title{Get linked articles (references, citations, or related) from OpenAlex}
\usage{
get_openalex_linked_new(
  ids,
  links = c("citations", "references", "related"),
  max_results = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{A character vector of identifiers (DOI, PMID, PMC ID, or OpenAlex
IDs). OpenAlex IDs can be provided as full URLs or short IDs. See
\code{get_openalex_articles_new()} for details on supported ID formats.}

\item{links}{A character vector specifying which types of linked articles to
retrieve. Any combination of \code{c("citations", "references", "related")}.
Default is all three types.}

\item{max_results}{Maximum number of results to return for citations
(references and related works are limited by what's available in the source
articles).}
}
\value{
A named list containing up to three data frames: \code{references},
\code{citations}, \code{related}. Each data frame has columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{source_id} - The OpenAlex ID of the queried article
(without URL prefix)
\item \code{linked_id} - The OpenAlex ID of the linked article
(without URL prefix)
}

Note: References and related works are extracted directly from the source
articles' metadata. Citations are found by querying for works that cite
the input articles.
}
\description{
This function retrieves linked articles (references, citations, or related
works) for given article IDs using the OpenAlex API. It uses the new
httr2-based implementation for better performance and reliability.
